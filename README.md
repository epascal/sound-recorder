# Sound Recorder

This is a sound recording application created in ReactJS. It is a learning exercise. Buyer beware.

This is, in many ways, a recreation of this [dictaphone web application](https://github.com/mdn/web-dictaphone/). 
However, with this version, I plan on making it a [PWA](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app/) 
so you can install it on your device and use it without an Internet connection.

## Live Demo

You can see a [live demo here](https://tedsecretsource.github.io/sound-recorder/) of the current development version.
